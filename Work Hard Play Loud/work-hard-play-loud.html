                    <p>Surrounded by more than 70,000 fans and standing on a podium overlooking Faurot Field, the reality of her role set in for senior Laura Cooke.</p>

<p>“Holy cow, I’m actually doing this,” Cooke said of conducting her first halftime show for Marching Mizzou as a drum major. Along with senior Keller Shelton, she captains the band.</p>

<p>Drum majors stand out in their all-white uniforms. They’re even more identifiable by their routine with maces, or “the really big sticks” they hold, as Cooke describes them, during the pregame show in which they lead the band for the Missouri Waltz. The routine is new this year, and Cooke hopes it becomes a tradition.</p>

<p>The changes in Marching Mizzou over time are hard to discern. The formations and music don’t drastically change. Big MO, the iconic bass drum at games, <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2012/8/31/new-big-mo-set-make-official-debut/" target="_blank">was replaced in 2012 after 40 years</a> when it was too worn out. Yet leaders in the organization, from Director Brad Snow to the drum majors, are working to improve the reputation of the band.</p>

<p>Snow, <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2010/9/3/mu-alumnus-takes-helm-marching-mizzou/" target="_blank">who is in his sixth year of directing at MU</a>, said the quality of the band has been raised in the last several years. The band has also been helped by additional funding from the College of Arts and Science.</p>

<hr><h2>A Gameday Tradition</h2>

<p>Marching Mizzou is an organization grounded in tradition. It’s been around for 130 years, dating back to 1885. The Missouri Waltz, the drills and the music have been around for decades.</p>

<p>The Waltz Step, the style of marching usually seen during the Missouri Waltz, is unique to Marching Mizzou. During band camp in August, two days are spent on mastering the step.</p>

<p>“It’s just kind of one of those traditional things that we are known for,” Snow said. “It’s one of those things that’s kind of sacred to the band. But it’s real hard.”</p>

<p>Cooke and Shelton are leading this tradition for the 2015 football season. They conduct the field shows, help with practices and organize events.</p>

<p>“It’s exciting that we’re a part of something that’s been around for that long,” Cooke said. “It’s crazy to think about sometimes, but it’s awesome.”</p>

<p>For Cooke, a general education major and the first woman to hold the drum major position in nine years, leading the band is a way to give back. Shelton, a music education major, said it’s another way to help the organization grow.</p>

<p>Before becoming drum majors, both marched for the past three years. Shelton played the baritone horn, and Cooke played the piccolo.</p>

<p>“Most people don’t expect the person with the tiniest instrument to lead the entire band,” she said.</p>

<blockquote>“(The band is) such a face of the university. There's such a love for the band. Can you imagine going to a game without a band?”<br>– Michael O’Brien, College of Arts and Sciences dean</blockquote>

<p>The 355-member band is a collection of students from all different majors and years. Marching Mizzou has been growing steadily since Snow became the director in 2010. The band was 250 members strong when he started.</p>

<p>Their budget also increased last year in response to the growing demands of the SEC, such as traveling to away conference games. The School of Music within the College of Arts and Science houses the band, and in the last two years, College of Arts and Science Dean Michael O’Brien committed an additional $175,000 for the marching band.</p>

<p>“(The band is) such a face of the university,” O’Brien said. “There's such a love for the band. Can you imagine going to a game without a band?”</p>

                <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/media/2015/1006/graphic.jpg"><img class="half-width" src="http://www.themaneater.com/media/2015/1006/graphic.jpg" alt="SEC Graphic" target="_blank"></a><br>

<p>As the band continues to grow, Shelton would also like to see additional facility upgrades. The band practices south of the Hearnes Center, but Shelton said crews are working on a new field to be ready by next season.</p>

<p>As drum majors, Cooke and Shelton will get the opportunity to conduct at the away games. However, only one drum major gets to go, so they alternate games. For the Georgia game on Oct. 17, Shelton will play and Cooke will conduct because both want to go on the road trip.</p>

<p>“Georgia is an iconic stadium,” Shelton said. “It’s a place that has a lot of tradition. I mean, we might get creamed, but it’s one of those places that I want to say that I’ve been to. They only have one spot for a drum major to go, but there’s an open spot in the baritone section, so both of us can go.”</p>

<hr><h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>

<p>Both Cooke and Shelton have dedicated the past four years to Marching Mizzou, meaning that each fall since 2012, they have been out on the practice field from 4:15 to 6 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays. On game days, they report for duty four hours before kickoff. Cooke said it’s busy, but not awful.</p>

<p>Shelton said there’s some grumbling about the early call time for 11 a.m. football games.</p>

<p>“A lot of it is the time commitment, and you would think people would understand that going in, but a lot of people don’t really understand what they are getting themselves into,” Shelton said.</p>

<p>Cooke said you also have to remember “that you're also at the university to get a degree and graduate.”</p>

<p>Snow said students put in hundreds of hours for the band.</p>

<p>“If you were to compensate them for the time they put in, it would be pennies on the dollar,” Snow said. “Daily, we rehearse about two hours a day and then gameday, it’s about an eight-hour time commitment. It’s hundreds of hours, and that just includes the time that they’re here. It doesn’t take into account what they are doing on their own, trying to memorize music and all that.”</p>

<p>Band members are required to take a specific class in order to travel and go on the field. It’s worth one credit, and the students have the option to pay for it or take it for no credit. Students can receive a scholarship to help offset the cost of the class, according to a newsletter sent to band members.</p>

<p>“There’s no glory for the students to be out there,” Snow said. “They do it because they love it. They aren’t on scholarship to do it. Only a handful of the members are receiving any kind of additional compensation for it. They do it because they love it.”</p>

<p>Snow personally auditioned each new member of this year’s band, a process that began in April 2015. Once accepted into the band, everyone attends band camp, which is the week before classes start in August.</p>

<p>Band camp is the largest uninterrupted block of rehearsal that Marching Mizzou has. The goal is to learn the pregame routine and the first halftime show.</p>

<p>The work on halftime shows starts six months beforehand when the directors sit down to plan out the schedule. Snow said they try to perform a wide variety of music, and they take suggestions from students. In the first three home games, they have played music from Maroon 5 and “The Sound of Music” as well as America-themed tunes.</p>

<p>Once the music is chosen, Snow must obtain copyrights and then design drills around the sets. Last year’s halftime performance against Indiana was planned several months out; the band formed a bow tie and a tiger on the field for MU’s 175th anniversary.</p>

<p>But the band isn’t just there for halftime. They play at kickoff, after scoring plays and in any other break in the game.</p>

<p>“We play a lot during the game,” Snow said. “I don’t think there’s another band that plays as much as we do. We literally play after every play.”</p>

<p>Snow likes to tell his students that they are “highly involved in providing the soundtrack for the game” along with <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2015/9/1/meet-man-behind-music-faurot-field/" target="_blank">DJ Beatz, the DJ for Faurot Field on game days</a>.</p>

<p>“We feel like we impact the momentum of the game by our involvement,” Snow said. “We are actively engaged the entire game, not just there for pregame and halftime.”</p>

<p>Beyond the game, the marching band is in demand for various gigs around campus and the greater MU community. Cooke and Shelton coordinate these events.</p>

<p>Associate Vice Chancellor for Alumni Relations Todd McCubbin said the band adds an elevated level of spirit wherever they play.</p>

<p>“Music has a funny way of taking you back in time so Marching Mizzou performances mean a lot to our events/alumni,” he said in an email.</p>

<hr><h2>Meet the Majors</h2>

<p>Shelton’s a huge football fan from Aledo, Texas, and he has had a prime seat for some key moments of Mizzou football.</p>

<p>The 2013 home game against Texas A&M to clinch the SEC East division title tops his list.</p>

<p>“I remember seeing Henry Josey break that run off for the touchdown and just losing my mind,” Shelton said.</p>

<p>The Arkansas game last season is a close second.</p>

<p>“The clearest memory I have from that game was when we scored the tying touchdown and we had to get the two-point conversion, and they ran that crazy trick play,” Shelton said. “That just sticks out to me so clearly because it was so crazy that it happened.”</p>

<p>At the end of both games, the fans rushed the field while the band stayed behind.</p>

<p>“We’d probably get in really big trouble if any of us tried to rush the field,” Shelton said.</p>

<p>While both of those games are in Cooke’s top four, last season’s road trip to Texas A&M stands out. Her arm was in a sling from a car accident and it was raining.</p>

<p>“It was cold and pouring down rain and it was so much fun,” she said. “We didn’t have a lot of fans there, so we were the fans ... I was just like, ‘Yes, football, let’s do this, I’m ready.’”</p>

<p>Cooke and Shelton have been playing in band since fifth grade and sixth grade, respectively. Cooke picked up the flute on a whim in fifth grade, and there was no turning back.</p>

<p>“It stuck really easily,” she said. “I don't even know what it was.”</p>

<p>Both aspire to be educators, and Shelton wants to be a band director someday.</p>

<p>“I really like the marching arts,” he said. “It’s something I’m really passionate about. It’s something I definitely want to do.”</p>

<p>Shelton didn’t come to MU specifically for the marching band. He was looking for something out of state where he could have an adventure.</p>

<p>“I knew I wanted the big school, big athletics, Division I kind of thing,” Shelton said. 
“The big marching band experience is part of that.”</p>

<p>Both are trying to do something different with the job, and that starts with the pregame routine, which is unique to them. This year, Cooke and Shelton have put together a routine with their maces with the help of the directors.</p>

<p>“We thought (the routine) would be cool,” Cooke said. “No one had done it in a really long time. We have (the maces); we might as well use them … We love the tradition of band. Being in an SEC school, the band is a much bigger deal than it was when we were in the Big 12.”</p>

<p>Cooke hopes elements such as the drum major routine will help make the band a bigger deal in the SEC, but she acknowledged that it will also take time. Winning the SEC East division the last two years helps too.</p>

<p>“It’s a lot of getting our name out there and showing people that we are an SEC band too,” she said. “We’re loud. We do cool things.”</p>

<p>For instance, at the Oct. 3 game against South Carolina, the band formed an eagle at the end of their halftime show as a bald eagle flew in from the stands and around the field.</p>

<img class="extra-width" src="http://www.themaneater.com/media/2015/1006/MMandGG_023.jpg" alt="023."><p class="caption">A bald eagle was released to fly over Marching Mizzou and the crowd during Marching Mizzou’s tribute to the U.S. Armed Forces during the halftime show of the South Carolina football game on Oct. 3 at Faurot Field. <span class="credit"><a href="http://www.themaneater.com/staff/view/jordan-kodner/">Jordan Kodner</a>/Staff Photographer</span></p><br>

<hr><h2>Becoming the Majors</h2>

<p>Shelton and Cooke didn’t become drum majors on their first try. Both auditioned in their junior years but didn’t make it. Shelton was a section leader for the baritones last year. Cooke was an unofficial section leader for the piccolos.</p>

<p>“They have to go through a fairly rigorous audition process in the spring that culminates with the Black and Gold scrimmage in April every year,” Snow said.</p>

<p>The first step in the process is a paper round of applications that includes resumes and letters of recommendation. For those that are qualified, the next steps are an interview and live audition. The selection is based off a combination of member vote, the resume and the live conducting tryout. There’s no set number for how many drum majors there can be.</p>

<p>Despite the obstacles, Cooke said she wanted to stick with it because it was something she really wanted.</p>

<p>Although Shelton and Cooke didn’t try out as a pair, both knew it would’ve been a good fit if the directors picked them together.</p>

<p>“We've been friends since freshman year,” Cooke said. “It worked really well that it's the two of us. First time since I’ve been here that there's been just two drum majors. (We have) very similar personalities and leadership styles. We knew it would go well if we got it together.”</p>

<p>Shelton, too, was optimistic that they’d be a good team.</p>

<p>“And I turned out to be right,” he said.</p>

<blockquote>“I’ve been playing since fifth grade and now to not play at all, it’s a little different. But it’s worth it to be able to be drum major.”<br>– Laura Cooke</blockquote>

<p>Cooke has had to learn a different skill set for her new role, from learning everyone’s music and spots to knowing the cues for all the music.</p>

<p>She’s also had to adjust to not playing.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I miss it, sometimes I don't … I've been playing since fifth grade and now to not play at all, it's a little different,” Cooke said. “But it's worth it to be able to be drum major.”</p>

<hr><h2>Why the Band</h2>

<p>O’Brien, dean of the College of Arts and Science, said that if fans were given the choice of having a football team or the band, “I think most people would say, ‘give me the band.’”</p>

<p>McCubbin, the vice chancellor, called the band “outstanding representatives of the university.”</p>

<p>For the members of Marching Mizzou, it’s more than being on the field for football games or representing the university.</p>

<p>“It's an immediate family once you get to college, which is super nice freshman year when you don't know anyone,” Cooke said. “We are all there doing the thing we enjoy doing. We enjoy making music and enjoy entertaining everyone.”</p>

<p>Shelton said the payoff on game days is worth it if you can get past the long days.</p>

<p>Cooke said she would’ve regretted not doing the band for all four years.</p>

<p>“Pretty much all of my friends are in Marching Mizzou, so it's a free excuse to see them eight hours a week and on game days,” Cooke said.</p>

<p>Shelton takes pride in the fact that Marching Mizzou is the one of the largest student groups on campus.</p> 

<p>“A lot of people don’t necessarily understand how much we do around town and in local schools, more than just football games and halftime,” Shelton said. “We work incredibly hard.”</p>

<p>Although the band has a tradition almost as long as the university, the drum majors are still focused on improving and growing for the future.</p>

<p>“We’ve really defined what Marching Mizzou is,” Cooke said. “The tradition that we hold, what kind of attitude we can have about Marching Mizzou. We work really hard during the week, we work really hard on game days, but it’s still a ton of fun.”</p>
